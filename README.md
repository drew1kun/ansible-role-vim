# Ansible role: vim

[![MIT licensed][mit-badge]][mit-link]
[![Galaxy Role][role-badge]][galaxy-link]

DEPRECATION NOTICE
----
This role is being deprecated in favor of [ansible-collection-slickshell][slickshell-github-link].

Collection on Galaxy: [drew1kun.slickshell][slickshell-galaxy-link]

Description
----

Ansible role that installs, configures and customizes vim editor.

The role does the following:

 - Removes **vim-tiny**
 - Installs **neovim** or **vim-nox** (required for Powerline plugin) depending on config
 - Sets `EDITOR` environment variable to use **neovim** (or **vim-nox** depending on config)
 - Installs [vim-plug][vim-plug-link] or [Vundle][vundle-link] plugin manager depending on config
 - Installs git (as a dependency for Vundle installation)
 - Installs set of Plugins defined in `default/main.yml`
 - Configures vim (system-wide or per-user) as defined in `default/main.yml` (using my custom configuration)
 - Installs [Solarized][solarized-link] and
   customized [Mustang][mustang-link] colorschemes.

IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA to install [Emoji][emoji-link] plugin both system-wide and per user.
Vim sources both system-wide and user's vimrc files and complains about duplicated emoji command.
This will also cause command `vim +PluginInstall +qall` to hang or fail.

If installing current role system-wide and per user, comment `junegunn/vim-emoji` in `default/main.yaml` for system
installation and uncomment it for per-user installation.

### Use case #1: install for shared usage

  You want to install a custom vim settings and plugins in your remote server. This config is shared between all server
  users, but customized settings for a single user is allowed if you want.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `system` in your playbook.

  The common config is placed in `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` (for settings) and `/etc/vim/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in
  these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  **Important**: by default, plugins are installed for `root` user. In all other users you have to install plugins
  manually with command `vim +PluginInstall`.

  Refer to [Vundle documentation][vundle-link] for plugin management.


### Use case #2: install for a single user

  You want to use this ansible role to provision your own laptop and just want a customized vim for your user.
  All your config lives in your `$HOME` path, just like regular vim install.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `user` in your playbook and set `vim_users` variable with a list of users to install vim.

  The common config is placed in `~/vimrc` (for settings) and `~/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  Refer to [Vundle documentation][vundle-link] for plugin management.

Requirements
----
Ansible  1.9 or greater

**NOTE:** If 'Down' task just hangs forever, this may be because of the following:
 - .vimrc or .vim files permissions (see 'which sudo' and become_method: su)
 - errors in .vimrc
 - misspelled plugin names: PlugInstall(or PluginInstall) triggers git, the "wish" GUI dialog for OpenSSH appears.
